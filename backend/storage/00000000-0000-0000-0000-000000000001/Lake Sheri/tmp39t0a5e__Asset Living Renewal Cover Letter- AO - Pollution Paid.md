The deadline to return an executed quote via DocuSign is **5:00 PM ET on Friday, March 28**. We realize this is a tight turnaround, but this year – as in recent years – it was in the program’s and its participants’ best interest to negotiate as long as possible. **Thank you for your patience, and your continued support of the program – we could not do it without the efforts of our clients.**

## Liability

- We continue to have full coverage (no exclusions or sublimits) for **Assault &amp; Battery** and **Abuse &amp; Molestation** unlike much of the rest of the marketplace.

## Buy Down and Financing Options

- If you would like a quote to buy down any of the property policy deductibles, please let us know and we will obtain that for you.
- Premium financing is available. Please just let us know if you need to explore financing for any of your locations and we will get you a quote. Financing can be arranged after binding and prior to paying your invoice so you do not have to make this decision before binding.

We realize that you may have questions. Please reach out to us at **assetliving@lockton.com** and we will respond as quickly as possible to answer those questions.
