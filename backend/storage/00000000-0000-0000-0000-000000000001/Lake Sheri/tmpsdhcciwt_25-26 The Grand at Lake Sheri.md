## Additional Terms and Conditions for Property Coverage:

- Blanket Program Limit: Subject to a $250,000,000 loss limit per occurrence.
- Sublimits are included in, and are not in addition to, the per occurrence primary policy limit. Additional sublimits/deductibles may apply as outlined in the policy.
- Shared Program Notice: This proposal is an offer to become part of this Asset Living Client-Exclusive Program along with other owners who are clients of Asset Living. All participants' coverage under the Program will share in the per occurrence limits as shown. In the event of a loss or accumulation of covered losses sustained by the members which collectively exceed the per occurrence limits over the policy year, payment to individual covered members will be made by the claims adjuster on a proportional basis; determined by dividing the total insurance limits available by the total loss and then applying the resulting factor to the individual member's loss amount.
- Tier One Named Windstorm Limits: This program contains a limit of $150,000,000 per occurrence limit for Named Windstorm in Tier One zones (see list of counties that qualify as tier one later in this proposal). It is the sole responsibility of the location owner to determine if this shared limit is adequate. We will provide information as requested to assist with any analysis you would like to make. Lockton and Asset Living make no representations as to the adequacy of this limit.
- The insured will be designated as an additional named insured under the policies and will have all the rights of an additional named insured as described in the policies.
- The property premiums quoted and applicable coverage terms are based upon the values reported by each owner in the Program for each property in the Program. These values consist of the building(s) replacement cost, personal property (if any), and loss of rental income. Each owner is solely responsible for carefully reviewing these values for their properties to determine accuracy and adequacy. This proposal is based upon those values.
- Coverage for loss or damage directly or indirectly resulting from structural renovations is excluded.

10. DISCLOSURE: In addition to premium paid to the insurance carrier(s) and premium taxes for the coverages noted above, the amount above includes compensation to the broker and/or Asset Living, other charges unrelated to premium which are collected and sent to Asset Living, which may include but are not limited to aggregate loss fund contributions calculated and maintained by Asset Living, risk management fee, fees and/or profits for the servicing, administration, data management, excess liability charges and management of the Program – all of which are non-refundable. You expressly consent to Asset Living's earning of any and all such fees and/or profits and understand that they are fully earned, confidential, will not be further disclosed, and will not be provided to you. The amount of premium, fees and contributions allocated to your location and other participants in the Program are based on various factors particular to the coverage and risk which may include, among others, location characteristics, market factors, loss history, geographic location, building structure and potential exposures unique to the risk. Program participants will be charged premium, administrative fees, and loss fund contributions at inception and for any mid-term additions to the Program. Lockton may deposit your payment in an interest-bearing account, along with payments from other entities affiliated with Asset Living and/or other Lockton clients, and Lockton will retain any interest earned on such funds while held prior to sending the funds to carrier(s) and/or Asset Living. Asset Living may authorize and instruct Lockton to forward to carrier(s), as and when necessary, any premium funds paid by any such entities and return premiums received against amounts due to fulfill the total premium obligations due for the coverage(s) procured by Asset Living for you and other entities under the Program for the applicable policy year and the applicable coverage. Administrative fees, aggregate loss funds, Umbrella and Excess Liability premium, and Pollution premium are 100% earned at binding and shall not be returned; however, other carrier premiums are 35% earned at binding. All property premium, including taxes and fees, for Tier 1 locations is 100% earned if coverage is in force at any point between June 1 and November 30. Your participation in the Program constitutes your acknowledgment, consent and agreement to the information provided above.

11. Full (100%) premium payment is required (no partial payments will be accepted) and is due and payable within 10 days of receipt of an invoice. Administrative fees, aggregate loss funds, Umbrella and Excess Liability premiums, and Pollution premium are 100% earned at binding and shall not be returned; however, other carrier premiums are 35% earned at binding. You are required to pay any invoice related to the Program by the invoice's due date. Failure to do so will result in a ten (10) day notice to immediately pay the outstanding invoice in full. Failure to make that payment timely will result in cancellation of coverage effective as of the date of inception. You give Asset Living the authority to draw upon any of your funds to which Asset Living has access pursuant to the management agreement to fulfill your payment obligations. Asset Living shall have no obligation to draw upon such funds to fulfill your payment obligations but may (or may not) exercise this authority in its sole discretion. If coverage is cancelled under the Program, then you will then be solely responsible for procuring your own insurance separate from the Program immediately in accordance with your insurance procurement obligations per the terms of the management agreement. Asset Living has arranged optional premium financing with a third-party financier (any third-party financier of any premiums due hereunder, ("premium financier"), which requires execution of a separate written agreement and is subject to additional terms and conditions. Should you finance any premiums with any premium financier, you give Asset Living the authority to draw upon any of your funds to which Asset Living has access pursuant to the management agreement to fulfill your payment obligations to any premium financier. Asset Living shall have no obligation to draw upon such funds to fulfill payment obligations to any premium financier but may (or may not) exercise this authority

in its sole discretion. If sufficient funds of yours are not available to Asset Living for Asset Living to make a payment due by you to a premium financier, you shall, upon notice consistent with any applicable laws regarding premium financing and related notices or, if none, no less than ten (10) days' notice to you: (a) make a payment to the premium financier for all amounts then due; or (b) provide funds to Asset Living for all amounts then due to the premium financier to permit Asset Living to make a payment to the premium financier with your funds on your behalf. Your failure to timely satisfy (a) or (b) above shall cause coverage to be cancelled effective either the inception date if missing payment(s) at issue was the first payment originally due to the premium financier or the date the missing payment was due if other than the first payment, and you will be solely responsible for procuring your own insurance separate from the Program immediately in accordance with your insurance procurement obligations per the terms of the management agreement. Any and all return premiums provided by carriers after coverage being cancelled as a result of owner not fulfilling its obligations to Asset Living and/or any premium financier shall be due and payable to Asset Living only and shall be the sole property of Asset Living.

12. Return premiums for the Program are reconciled on a quarterly basis. If a property is sold, or coverage is terminated, during the policy term, we will report this to the carriers, and it will be included on the quarterly report. Once the quarter ends, the carriers have 90 days to send endorsements and to process the return premium. This is a function of the shared and layered program that is unavoidable. The return premium will not be refunded until made available by every carrier (all funds received at once and provided at once). If a location is premium financed and sells during the policy term, it's still reported within the quarterly report to the carriers - the property can pay off the remaining loan or continue to pay monthly installments until the return premium is received from the carriers to pay off the loan once the quarterly report is finalized.

Q1: April 1 – June 30 / Q2: July 1 – September 30 / Q3: October 1 – December 31 / Q4: January 1 – March 31

13. You agree to fully fund the deductible at the inception of any claim made under the Program related to your location. Asset Living will only be required to tender a claim under the general liability coverage to the applicable carrier(s) upon receipt of the fully funded deductible or self-insured retention from you. You agree and consent to Asset Living funding any required deductibles from any accounts of yours for which Asset Living has access. In the event the claim related to your location is closed and the deductible is not fully exhausted, then the remainder of any of your funds that were tendered to Asset Living at the inception of the claim to satisfy your deductible obligation will be returned to you promptly. You agree that Asset Living is not responsible in any way to fund or otherwise pay for the deductible and that the deductible does not fall within any obligation that Asset Living may have to you in the management agreement or otherwise.

14. You are not permitted to submit a claim relating to your location without first submitting the claim to Asset Living or Lockton and you agree you will submit the claim first to Asset Living or Lockton. You are responsible for submitting a 'proof of loss' statement executed by you and/or approved by you for Asset Living to execute on your behalf. You are not permitted to hire contractors to adjust and/or perform work that will be part of a claim without written approval from Asset and/or Lockton, which either or both of them may withhold in their sole and absolute discretion. This provision shall not apply in the event you need to incur costs to prevent imminent additional damage. You shall only submit claims for which you have a reasonable and good faith basis for coverage, and you must cooperate with Asset Living, Lockton, any of their preferred adjusters, and any carriers regarding any claim. You agree to use the adjusters and/or related claims consultants provided by Lockton and/or the carrier who issued the

insurance policy at issue in the claim, including the Program's preferred owner representative consultant, who will be made available to you. If you decide, for some reason, after working with the Program's preferred owner representative consultant as your representative, to separately retain a public adjuster or additional claims consultant, you acknowledge and agree that any such fees or expenses of the public adjuster or additional claims consultant (beyond the Program's preferred owner representative consultant) are your sole responsibility, whether you pay for them separately or from any insurance proceeds you receive. COSTS FOR YOUR SEPARATE PUBLIC ADJUSTER OR CLAIMS CONSULTANT ARE EXCLUDED UNDER THIS PROGRAM AND WILL NOT BE COVERED UNDER THE INSURANCE POLICIES AND WILL NOT COUNT TOWARDS ANY DEDUCTIBLE OR SELF-INSURED RETENTION. YOU ALSO ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT, IN NO EVENT, DO ASSET LIVING AND/OR LOCKTON HAVE ANY OBLIGATION TO PAY ANY SUCH FEES OR EXPENSES. You also acknowledge and agree that neither Asset Living nor Lockton are responsible for any difference in your claimed and/or actual damages and the amount the carrier pays on your claim. Any dispute regarding the claim, including any discrepancy in the covered amounts, is between you and the carrier.

15. Regarding claims by third parties against you, you are required to immediately provide notice and any legal documentation received to the following email address: assetliving@lockton.com. You may be held responsible for associated costs if failure to do so jeopardizes coverage for the claim. Asset Living or Lockton have the authority to report claims as required by the carriers. Asset Living reserves the right to settle any liability claim, including claims within the self-insured retention or deductible of the applicable policy(ies).

16. Sublimits are included in, and are not in addition to, the per occurrence primary policy limit. Additional sublimits/deductibles may apply as outlined in the policy.

17. Shared Program Notice: This quote is an offer to become part of the Program along with other owners who are clients of Asset Living. All participants' coverage under the Program will share in the per occurrence limits as shown. In the event of a loss or accumulation of covered losses sustained by the members which collectively exceed the per occurrence limits over the policy year, payment to individual covered members will be made by the claims adjuster on a proportional basis; determined by dividing the total insurance limits available by the total loss and then applying the resulting factor to the individual member's loss amount.

18. The insured will be designated as an additional named insured under the policies procured by the insured pursuant to the Program terms and will have all of the rights of an additional named insured as described in the policies.

19. The property premiums quoted and applicable coverage terms are based upon the values reported, and/or agreed to (via quote acceptance), by each participant in the Program for each location in the Program. These values consist of the building(s) replacement cost, personal property (if any) and loss of rental income. Each participant is solely responsible for carefully reviewing these values to determine accuracy and adequacy relating to their location(s). This quote is based upon those values. Asset Living and Lockton have established minimum valuations based on industry standards that are required for participation in the Program. You represent and warrant that the information you have provided is accurate and complete and that you are solely responsible for providing the information upon which the property premium and coverage term quotes are based. Neither Asset Living nor Lockton are responsible or obligated to provide information upon which premiums and coverage terms are quoted. Asset Living and Lockton have the right to terminate and/or cancel coverage for your material failure to disclose accurate
