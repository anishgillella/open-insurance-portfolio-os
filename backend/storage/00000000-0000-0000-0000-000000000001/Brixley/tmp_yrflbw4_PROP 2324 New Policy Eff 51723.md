# ALLOCATION OF LIABILITY:

The contracts herein cover mutually exclusive perils. The maximum limit of liability is not to exceed the per occurrence participation stated herein, regardless of whether multiple perils and multiple contracts are involved. Recognition of liability by either of the contracts reduces the limit of liability of any corresponding contract.

The liability otherwise determined to exist under the terms and conditions of this policy shall be borne by the contract covering the proximate cause of loss identified in the allocation of security. Any loss covered by the policy by a peril not allocated to a contract herein shall be borne by the contract covering the most comprehensive perils, generally in accordance with the ISO Special Causes of Loss Contracts. The liability of the policy shall not be increased or decreased by any condition of the allocation to specific contracts on this endorsement.

Covered perils shall be defined by the applicable forms attached to this policy or otherwise as per the industry standard definition.

# SECTION IV – VALUATION

Except as otherwise provided in this Paragraph, adjustment of loss or damage under this Policy shall be valued at the cost to repair or replace (whichever is less) at the time and place of the loss with materials of like kind and quality, without deduction for depreciation and obsolescence. The Insured may elect to rebuild on another site, provided that, such rebuilding does not increase the amount of loss or damage that would otherwise be payable to rebuild at the same site. However, if the property is not repaired, rebuilt or replaced as soon as reasonably possible after the loss or damage, the value of the property will be determined on an Actual Cash Value basis. In the event the Insured elects to have the loss or damage settled on an Actual Cash Value basis, the Insured may still make a claim on a replacement cost basis, provided the Insured notifies the Companies within 180 days after the loss or damage.

Unless otherwise endorsed hereon, the property, as described below, will be valued as follows:

A. Stock in process: the cost of raw materials and labor expended, plus the proper proportion of overhead charges.

B. Finished goods manufactured by the Insured: the regular cash selling price at the location where the loss occurs, less all discounts and charges to which the merchandise would have been subject had no loss occurred.

C. Raw materials, supplies and other merchandise not manufactured by the Insured: the replacement cost.

D. Valuable Papers and Records: the cost to replace or restore the property with like kind and quality including the cost to research, gather and assemble information. If not replaced, the Companies will only pay the blank value of the valuable papers or records.

E. Electronic Data and Media: the cost of the blank media, plus the costs of copying the Electronic Data and Media from back-up or from originals of a previous generation. These costs will not include research and engineering nor any costs of recreating, gathering or assembling such Electronic Data and Media. If the Electronic Data and Media is not repaired, replaced or restored, the basis of valuation shall be the cost of the blank media. However, this Policy does not insure any amount pertaining to the value of such Electronic Data and Media to the Insured or any other party, even if such Electronic Data and Media cannot be recreated, gathered or assembled.

F. Jigs and fixtures, dies, small tools, patterns, employees' personal property and personal property of third parties: the replacement cost if replacement cost values have been reported to the Companies and if actually replaced; otherwise the Actual Cash Value, but not to exceed the cost to repair or replace the property with material of like kind and quality.

G. Leasehold improvements and betterments:

1. If repaired or replaced at the expense of the Insured within two (2) years after the date of the loss, the cost to repair or replace the damaged improvements and betterments.

2. If not repaired or replaced within two (2) years after the date of the loss, a proportion of the Insured's original cost.

The Companies will determine the proportionate value as follows:

COMPASS 04 18
Page 10 of 42

---

<!-- Page 30 -->
a. Multiply the original cost by the number of days from the loss or damage to the expiration of the lease; and
b. Divide the amount determined in Subparagraph a. above by the number of days from the installation of improvements to the expiration of the lease.

If the Insured's lease contains a renewal option, the expiration of the renewal option period will replace the expiration of the lease in this procedure; or

3. Nothing, if others pay for repairs or replacement.

H. Fine Arts:

1. If there is no Agreed Value Schedule on file with the Program Manager, then the lesser of:
a. The cost to repair or replace the fine art, or
b. The appraised value, which will be determined as of the time of the loss.

2. If there is an Agreed Value Schedule on file with the Program Manager, then the Agreed Value Schedule shall be used.

3. If a Fine Arts article is part of a pair or set, and a physically damaged article cannot be replaced, or cannot be repaired or restored to the condition that existed immediately prior to the loss, the Companies will be liable for the lesser of the full value of such pair or set or the Agreed Value, as per the schedule on file with the Program Manager. The Insured will surrender the pair or set to the Companies.

I. Accounts Receivable: the amount owed the Insured which the Insured is unable to collect from customers, and shall include:

1. Any collection expenses over and above the normal collection costs;
2. Interest charges on any loan to offset impaired collections pending repayment of such sums that cannot be collected; and
3. Other reasonable and necessary expenses incurred by the Insured to recreate Accounts Receivable Records.

Unearned interest and service charges on deferred payment accounts and normal credit losses on bad debts shall be deducted in determining the recovery hereunder.

After payment of loss by the Companies, all amounts recovered by the Insured on Accounts Receivable for which the Insured has been paid will belong to and will be paid to the Companies by the Insured up to the total amount of loss paid by these Companies. All recoveries in excess of such amounts will belong to the Insured.

In the event it is possible to reconstruct the Insured's Accounts Receivable Records after they have been physically lost or damaged, so that no shortage in collection of Accounts Receivable is sustained, the Companies shall only be liable for the costs of the material and the time required to reconstruct such records, with the exercise of due diligence and dispatch, but only to the extent that such amounts are not covered by any other insurance.

J. Property for Sale: If, at the time of the loss, any real property is being offered for sale, the loss or damage to such property will be valued at the lesser of:

1. The cost to repair or replace the damaged property, or
2. The price at which the property is offered for sale less the market value of the Land.

COMPASS 04 18

<!-- Page 31 -->
K. Property in Transit: In case of loss, the basis of adjustment shall be:

1. Property shipped to or for the account of the Insured: the actual invoice to the Insured, together with such costs and charges as may have accrued and become legally due on such property;
2. Property which has been sold by the Insured and has been shipped to or for account of the purchaser (if covered hereunder): the amount of the Insured's selling invoice, including prepaid or advanced freight;
3. Property of others not under invoice: the actual market value at the point of destination on the date of the Occurrence, less any charges saved which would have become due and payable upon delivery at destination; or
4. Property of the Insured not under invoice: valued in accordance with the valuation provisions of this Policy applying at the location from which such property is being transported, less any charges saved which would have become due and payable upon delivery at such destination.

L. Contractor's equipment and vehicles (if covered): Actual Cash Value, unless an agreed value applies.
M. Catalyst: Actual Cash Value.
N. Historic Building Replacement Cost: As respects buildings that are declared and designated by a local, state or federal authority to be of historical significance or of historic value, such rebuilding, repairing or replacement shall be with material, workmanship, processes, technologies and designs publicly available within the current marketplace that most closely resemble those that existed before the loss or damage occurred and are based on the most reasonable cost available at the time the loss occurred, and shall not include the cost of creating outdated, archaic or antiquated materials, workmanship, processes, technologies or designs. In no event shall the loss exceed the scheduled limit on the damaged Building.
O. For all other property: At replacement cost if actually replaced; otherwise, the Actual Cash Value, but not to exceed the cost to repair or replace the property with material of like kind and quality.

With respect to Subparagraphs A. through O., inclusive, unless otherwise specifically stated, the Companies will compute the valuations at the time and place of the loss.

# SECTION V – TIME ELEMENT COVERAGE GROSS EARNINGS

This Policy is extended to cover the actual loss sustained by the Insured during the Period of Interruption directly resulting from a Covered Cause of Loss to Covered Property.

1. To make up lost production within a reasonable period of time (not to be limited to the period during which production is interrupted), or
2. To continue business operations or services,

all through the use of any property or service owned or controlled by the Insured, or obtainable from other sources, whether the property or service is at an insured Location or through working extra time or overtime at any other substitute location(s), including any other location(s) acquired for the purpose, then the Companies shall be liable, subject to all other conditions of this Policy not inconsistent herewith, for the actual loss sustained of the following during the Period of Interruption:

COMPASS 04 18
Page 12 of 42

---

<!-- Page 32 -->
1. GROSS EARNINGS less all charges and expenses which do not necessarily continue during the interruption of production or suspension of business operations or services. For the purpose of this coverage, GROSS EARNINGS means:

a. For manufacturing operations: The net sales value of production less the cost of all raw stock, materials and supplies utilized in such production; or
b. For mercantile or non-manufacturing operations: The total net sales less cost of merchandise sold, materials and supplies consumed in the operations or services rendered by the Insured;
c. Plus all other earnings derived from the operation of the business.

In determining net sales, in the event of loss hereunder, for mercantile or non-manufacturing operations, any amount recovered under Property Damage policies for loss or damage to or destruction of merchandise shall be included as though the merchandise had been sold to the Insured's regular customers.

In determining the amount of loss payable under this coverage, due consideration shall be given to the experience of the business before the Period of Interruption and the probable experience thereafter had no loss occurred, and to the continuation of only those normal charges and expenses, including payroll (subject to the Ordinary Payroll restriction below), that would have existed had no interruption of production or suspension of business operations or services occurred.

There is no coverage for any portion of the Insured's Ordinary Payroll expense, unless a specified number of days for Ordinary Payroll are shown elsewhere and values have been included in the reported Time Element Values. In such case, the Companies will pay Ordinary Payroll for that number of days only. The number of days need not be consecutive, but must fall within the interruption of production or suspension of business operations or services, or fall within the extension of that period, if an extension is provided. Ordinary Payroll means the entire payroll expense for all employees of the Insured except officers, executives, department managers, employees under contract, and other essential employees.

2. EXPENSE TO REDUCE LOSS: Expenses, over and above normal operating expenses, necessarily incurred by the Insured in making up lost production or in reducing loss otherwise payable under this coverage are covered hereunder, but in no event shall these Companies be liable for an amount greater than that for which it would have been liable had the Insured been unable to make up any lost production or to continue any business operations or services.

B. PERIOD OF INTERRUPTION: In determining the amount payable under this coverage, the Period of Interruption shall be:

1. The period from the time of physical loss or damage insured against by this Policy to the time when, with the exercise of due diligence and dispatch, either:

a. normal operations resume; or
b. physically damaged buildings and equipment could be repaired or replaced and made ready for operations under the same or equivalent physical and operating conditions that existed prior to such loss or damage,

whichever is less. Such period of time shall not be cut short by the expiration or earlier termination date of the Policy.

2. In addition, if applicable, such time as may be required with the exercise of due diligence and dispatch:

a. To restore stock in process to the same state of manufacture in which it stood at the time of the initial interruption of production or suspension of business operations or services; or

COMPASS 04 18
Page 13 of 42

---

<!-- Page 33 -->
b. To replace physically damaged or destroyed mercantile stock necessary to resume operations; or
c. To replace raw materials and supplies in order to continue operations.

However, the inability to procure destroyed mercantile stock or suitable raw materials and supplies to replace similar stock or materials and supplies physically damaged or destroyed shall not increase the Period of Interruption.

3. For Property under construction: The time period between the anticipated date of substantial completion had no covered loss occurred and the actual date of completion. In calculating the amount of loss, due consideration will be given to the actual experience of the business compiled after substantial completion and start-up.

The Period of Interruption does not include any additional time:

a. Required for re-staffing or re-training employees; or
b. Due to the Insured's inability to resume operations for reasons other than those enumerated in B.2.a. through B.2.c., inclusive, above; or
c. Required for making change(s) to the buildings, structures, or equipment for any reason except as provided in the Ordinance or Law coverage, if such coverage is provided by this Policy.

1. EXTRA EXPENSE/EXPEDITING EXPENSE: This Policy is extended to cover the loss sustained by the Insured for Extra Expense during the Period of Interruption resulting from direct physical loss or damage from a Covered Cause of Loss to Covered Property utilized by the Insured. Extra Expense means:

a. The reasonable and necessary extra expense incurred to temporarily continue as nearly normal as practicable the conduct of the Insured's business;
b. The reasonable and necessary extra costs of temporarily using property or facilities of the Insured or others; and
c. The reasonable extra costs (expediting expenses) for temporary repair of damaged property and for expediting the permanent repair or replacement of such damaged property. This includes overtime wages and extra costs of express or other rapid means of transportation. This does not include expenses recoverable elsewhere under this policy.

The Insured agrees to use any suitable property or service owned or controlled by the Insured or obtainable from other sources in reducing the Business Income and Extra Expense incurred under this Policy.

2. RENTAL VALUE: As respects Covered Property held for rental to others, this Policy is extended to cover the loss sustained during the Period of Interruption, but not exceeding the reduction in Rental Value less charges and expenses which do not necessarily continue.

Rental Value means the sum of:

a. The total anticipated gross rental income from tenant occupancy of the described property as furnished and equipped by the Insured including taxes, rent based on percentage of sales, and other charges paid by tenants in respect of the leased premises; and
b. The amount of all charges which, by the terms of a written lease, are the legal obligation of the tenant(s) and which would otherwise be obligations of the Insured; and

b. Realty taxes and ground rent, if any;
c. Advertising and promotional expenses;

5. CONTINGENT TIME ELEMENT: If direct physical loss or damage to the real or personal property of a direct supplier or direct customer of the Insured is damaged by a Covered Cause of Loss under this Policy, and such damage:

a. wholly or partially prevents any direct supplier to the Insured from supplying their goods and/or services to the Insured; or
b. wholly or partially prevents any direct customer of the Insured from accepting the Insured's goods and/or services;

The insured physical loss or damage must occur within five (5) statute miles from the Insured's covered Location in order for coverage to apply. Such period of time begins on the date that ingress to or egress from real or personal property is prohibited and ends when ingress or egress is no longer prohibited, but no later than the number of days shown elsewhere.

With respect to Additional Time Element Coverages 6. &amp; 7., if a Covered Cause of Loss results in coverage under both Additional Time Element Coverages, the Companies will only pay for loss under one of the two Additional Time Element Coverages, whichever the First Named Insured selects.

8. INTERDEPENDENCY: This Policy is extended to cover a Time Element loss at an insured Location that involves interdependency at one or more other insured Locations, all within the Policy's Coverage Territory. The loss, including the resulting interdependency loss, will be adjusted based on the Time Element coverage that applies at the insured Location where the covered physical loss or damage occurred.

9. EXTENDED PERIOD OF INDEMNITY: Coverage is provided for such additional length of time as is required to restore the Insured's business to the condition that would have existed had no loss occurred, commencing with the later of the following dates:

a. the date on which the liability of the Companies for loss or damage would otherwise terminate; or
b. the earliest date on which either normal operations resume, or repair, replacement, or rebuilding of the property that has been damaged is actually completed;

Nothing herein shall affect the rights of the Companies to suspend insurance [which shall include any insurance applying to the interest of the Loss Payee, Lender's Loss Payee, or Mortgagee (or Trustee)] on any machine, vessel or part thereof in accordance with the Suspension Clause of Equipment Breakdown (if such coverage is provided by endorsement to this policy). The Companies agree to furnish the Loss Payee, Lender's Loss Payee, or Mortgagee (or Trustee) with a copy of the suspension notice at the Loss Payee's, Lender's Loss Payee's, or Mortgagee's (or Trustee's) address.

5. Whenever the Companies shall pay the Loss Payee, Lender's Loss Payee, or Mortgagee (or Trustee) any sum for loss under this Policy and shall claim that, as to the Insured, no liability therefor existed, the Companies shall, to the extent of such payment, be subrogated to all the rights of the party to whom such payment shall be made, under all securities held as collateral to the debt, or may, at their option pay to the Loss Payee, Lender's Loss Payee, or Mortgagee (or Trustee) the whole principal due or to grow due on the debt with interest, and shall thereupon receive a full assignment and transfer of all rights and securities; but no subrogation shall impair the right of the Loss Payee, Lender's Loss Payee, or Mortgagee (or Trustee) to recover the full amount of the Loss Payee's, Lender's Loss Payee's or Mortgagee's (or Trustee's) claim.

O. MISREPRESENTATION AND FRAUD: This entire Policy shall be void if, whether before or after a loss, the Insured has willfully concealed or misrepresented any material fact or circumstance concerning this insurance or the subject thereof, or the interest of the Insured therein, or in case of any fraud, or false swearing by the Insured relating thereto.

P. OTHER INSURANCE/EXCESS INSURANCE/UNDERLYING INSURANCE: In the event there is other insurance covering loss or damage insured under this Policy, then this Policy shall apply only as excess and in no event as contributory insurance (unless this Policy is specifically written to be contributory insurance), and then only after all other insurance has been exhausted, whether or not such insurance is collectible. Permission is granted for the Insured to purchase Excess Insurance over the limits provided by this Policy, and underlying insurance on all or any part of the deductibles of this Policy.

U. SALVAGE AND RECOVERIES: All salvages, recoveries and payments, excluding proceeds from subrogation and underlying insurance recovered or received prior to a loss settlement under this Policy, shall reduce the loss accordingly.

V. SETTLEMENT OF CLAIMS: The amount of loss for which the Companies may be liable shall be payable within thirty (30) days after Proof of Loss, as herein required, is received and accepted by the Companies and ascertainment of the amount of loss is made either by agreement between the First Named Insured and the Companies or an amount is determined by binding Arbitration in accordance with the provisions of this Policy.

W. SEVERAL LIABILITY NOTICE
LMA5096 03/08 (Combined Certificate) - amended

The liability of an insurer under this Policy is several and not joint with other insurers party to this Policy. An insurer is liable only for the proportion of liability it has underwritten. An insurer is not jointly liable for the proportion of liability underwritten by any other insurer. Nor is an insurer otherwise responsible for any liability of any other insurer that may underwrite this Policy.

The proportion of liability under this Policy underwritten by an insurer (or, in the case of a Lloyd's syndicate, the total of the proportions underwritten by all the members of the syndicate taken together) is shown in this Policy.

In the case of a Lloyd's syndicate, each member of the syndicate (rather than the syndicate itself) is an insurer. Each member has underwritten a proportion of the total shown for the syndicate (that total itself being the total of the proportions underwritten by all the members of the syndicate taken together). The liability of each member of the syndicate is several and not joint with other members. A member is liable only for that member's proportion. A member is not jointly liable for any other member's proportion. Nor is any member otherwise responsible for any liability of any other insurer that may underwrite this Policy. The business address of each member is Lloyd's, One Lime Street, London EC3M 7HA United Kingdom. The identity of each member of a Lloyd's syndicate and their respective proportion may be obtained by writing to Market Services, Lloyd's, at the above address. Although reference is made at various points in this clause to "this Policy" in the singular, where the circumstances so require this should be read as a reference to Policies in the plural.

Wherever the word Insurers is mentioned in this clause, this is deemed to also mean reinsured in respect of reinsurance business.

X. SUBROGATION: The Companies may require from the Insured an assignment of all right of recovery against any party for loss to the extent that payment has been made by the Companies, but the Companies shall not acquire any rights of recovery which the Insured has expressly waived in writing prior to loss nor shall such waiver in writing affect the Insured's rights under this Policy.

The Companies do waive rights of recovery against any unit-owner of a Condominium Association.

However, notwithstanding the foregoing, the Companies shall be subrogated to all the Insured's rights of recover against:

1. any Architect or Engineer, whether named as an Insured or not, for any loss or damage arising out of the performance of professional services in their capacity as such and caused by an error, omission, deficiency or act of the Architect or Engineer, by any person employed by them or by any others for whose acts they are legally liable, and
2. any manufacturer or supplier of machinery, equipment or other property, whether named as an Insured or not, for the cost of making good any loss or damage which said party has agreed to make good under a guarantee or warranty, whether expressed or implied.

Any recovery as a result of subrogation proceedings arising out of an Occurrence, after expenses incurred in such subrogation proceedings are deducted, shall accrue to the Insured in the proportion that the deductible amount and/or any provable uninsured loss amount bears to the entire provable loss amount.

The Insured will cooperate with the Companies and, upon the Companies' request and expense will:

1. Attend hearings and trials; and
2. Assist in effecting settlements, securing and giving evidence, obtaining the attendance of witnesses, and conducting suits.

Y. SUIT AGAINST COMPANIES: No suit, action or proceeding for the recovery of any claim under this Policy shall be sustainable in any court of law or equity unless the Insured shall have fully complied with all the requirements of this Policy, nor unless the same be commenced within twelve (12) months next after the date of the loss, provided however, that if under the laws of the jurisdiction in which the property is located such time limitation is invalid, then any such claims shall be void unless such action, suit or proceedings is commenced within the shortest limit of time permitted by the laws of such jurisdiction.

Z. TERRITORIAL LIMITATIONS: Payment of loss under this Policy shall only be made in full compliance with all United States of America economic or trade sanction laws or regulations, including, but not limited to, sanctions, laws and regulations administered and enforced by the U.S. Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Assets Control ("OFAC").

AA. TITLES OF PARAGRAPHS: The titles of the various paragraphs of this Policy (and of endorsements included in this Policy) are solely for reference and shall not in any way affect the provisions to which they relate.

BB. VACANCY: The Insured has permission to cease operations or remain vacant or unoccupied at an insured Location for up to 90 days. Beyond the 90th consecutive day of cessation of operations, vacancy or not occupied, whether or not that period of time commenced prior to or during the Policy Period, any loss or damage caused by or resulting, directly or indirectly, from Vandalism and Malicious Mischief, sprinkler leakage, glass breakage, water, theft or attempted theft is excluded; however these restrictions in coverage will not apply if the Insured maintains existing heat, fire protection, security and alarm services.

This restriction does not apply to any Location in the course of construction or renovation.

Actual Cash Value is calculated as the amount it would cost to repair or replace Covered Property, at the time of loss or damage, with material of like kind and quality, subject to a deduction for deterioration, depreciation and obsolescence. Actual Cash Value applies to valuation of Covered Property regardless of whether that property has sustained partial or total loss or damage.

The Actual Cash Value of the lost or damaged property may be significantly less than its replacement cost.

B. Aircraft or Vehicle Impact means only physical contact of an aircraft, spacecraft, self-propelled missile, or objects falling therefrom, or vehicle or an object thrown up by a vehicle.

C. Average Daily Value (ADV): Average Daily Value shall be the total 100% Time Element Value that would have been projected for the Period of Interruption for the Location(s) where the physical loss or damage occurs, had no physical loss or damage occurred, divided by the number of working days in such period. The sum shall include all Time Element values to which the operations of the Locations(s) directly or indirectly contribute.

However, structural damage consisting merely of the settling or cracking of a foundation, structure or building does not constitute loss or damage resulting from a catastrophic ground cover collapse.

The Earth Movement exclusion does not apply to coverage for Catastrophic Ground Cover Collapse.

Coverage for Catastrophic Ground Cover Collapse does not increase the applicable Limit of Insurance. Regardless of whether loss or damage attributable to catastrophic ground cover collapse also qualifies as Sinkhole Loss or Earth Movement (if either or both of these causes of loss are covered), only one Limit of Insurance will apply to such loss or damage.

F. Collapse means an abrupt falling down or caving in of a building or any part of a building with the result that the building or part of the building cannot be occupied for its current intended purpose. The Collapse must be caused by or resulting from one or more of the following:

1. As respects locations in all states, EXCEPT Florida:

Sinkhole Loss means: The sudden sinking or collapse of land into underground empty spaces created by the action of water on limestone or dolomite. This does not include:

a. The cost of filling sinkholes; or
b. Sinking or collapse of land into man-made underground cavities.

2. As respects locations in Florida:

a. Sinkhole Loss, means loss or damage to Covered Property when "structural damage" to the covered Building, including the foundation, is caused by settlement or systematic weakening of the earth supporting the covered Building, only if the settlement or systematic weakening results from contemporaneous movement or raveling of soils, sediments, or rock materials into subterranean voids created by the effect of water on a limestone or similar rock formation.

Coverage for Sinkhole Loss includes stabilization of the Building (including land stabilization) and repair to the foundation, provided such work is in accordance with the requirements of Florida Insurance Law and in accordance with the recommendation of a professional engineer and with notice to the Insured. The professional engineer must be selected or approved by the Companies. However, until the Insured enters into a contract for performance of building stabilization or foundation repair in accordance with the recommendations of the professional engineer as set forth in a report from the Companies:

1) The Companies will not pay for underpinning or grouting or any other repair technique performed below the existing foundation of the Building; and
2) The Companies' payment for Sinkhole Loss to Covered Property may be limited to the Actual Cash Value of the loss to such property.

The Insured must enter into a contract for the performance of building stabilization and/or foundation repair in accordance with the aforementioned recommendations, within 90 days after the Companies notify the Insured that there is coverage for Sinkhole Loss. After the Insured has entered into such contract, the Companies will pay the amounts necessary to begin and perform such repairs as the work is performed and the expenses are incurred.

However, if the professional engineer determines, prior to the Insured entering into the aforementioned contract or prior to the start of repair work, that the repairs will exceed the applicable Limit of Insurance, the Companies must either complete the recommended repairs or pay that Limit of Insurance upon such determination. If the aforementioned determination is made during the course of repair work and the Companies have begun making payments

COMPASS 04 18
Page 37 of 42

---

<!-- Page 57 -->
for the work performed, the Companies must either complete the recommended repairs or pay only the remaining portion of the applicable Limit of Insurance upon such determination. The most the Companies will pay for the total of all Sinkhole Loss, including Building and land stabilization and foundation repair, is the applicable Limit of Insurance on the affected Building.

The stabilization and all other repairs to the Covered Property must be completed within 12 months after entering into the contract for the performance of these repairs, unless:

1) There is a mutual agreement between the Insured and the Companies;
2) The claim is involved with the neutral evaluation process;
3) The claim is in litigation; or
4) The claim is under appraisal or mediation.

b. Sinkhole Loss does not include:

1) Sinking or collapse of land into man-made underground cavities; or
2) Earthquake.

c. With respect to a claim for alleged Sinkhole Loss, the following provision is added:

Following receipt by the Companies of a report from a professional engineer or professional geologist on the cause of loss and recommendations for land stabilization and repair of property, or if the Companies deny the claim, the Companies will notify the Insured of his right to participate in a neutral evaluation program administered by the Florida Department of Financial Services (hereinafter referred to as the Department). For alleged Sinkhole Loss to commercial residential or farm residential properties, this program applies instead of any mediation procedure set forth elsewhere in this policy, but does not invalidate the Appraisal Condition.

Either party may file a request with the Department for neutral evaluation; the other party must comply with such request. The Companies will pay reasonable costs associated with the neutral evaluation, regardless of which party makes the request. But if a party chooses to hire a court reporter or stenographer to contemporaneously record and document the neutral evaluation, that party must bear the costs of those services. The neutral evaluator will be selected from a list maintained by the Department. The recommendation of the neutral evaluator will not be binding on either party.

Participation in the neutral evaluation program does not change the Insured's right to file suit against the Companies, except that the time for filing suit is extended for a period of 60 days following the conclusion of the neutral evaluation process or five years, whichever is later.

d. Coverage for Sinkhole Loss does not increase the applicable Limit of Insurance. Even if loss or damage qualifies under, or includes, both Catastrophic Ground Cover Collapse (addressed elsewhere) and Sinkhole Loss, only one Limit of Insurance will apply to such loss or damage.

e. The following provision is added to the REQUIREMENTS IN CASE OF LOSS Condition:

COMPASS 04 18
Page 38 of 42

---

<!-- Page 58 -->
A claim for Sinkhole Loss, including but not limited to initial, supplemental and reopened claims is barred unless notice of claim is provided to the Companies in accordance with the terms of this policy within two years after the Insured knew or reasonably should have known about the Sinkhole Loss.

1) "Structural damage" means a covered **Building**, regardless of the date of its construction, has experienced the following:

a) Interior floor displacement or deflection in excess of acceptable variances as defined in ACI 117-90 or the Florida Building Code, which results in settlement related damage to the interior such that the interior **Building** structure or members become unfit for service or represent a safety hazard as defined within the Florida Building Code;

b) Foundation displacement or deflection in excess of acceptable variances as defined in ACI 318-95 or the Florida Building Code, which results in settlement related damage to the "primary structural members" or "primary structural systems" and that prevents those members or systems from supporting the loads and forces they were designed to support to the extent that stresses in those "primary structural members" or "primary structural systems" exceed one and one-third the nominal strength allowed under the Florida Building Code for new buildings of similar structure, purpose, or location;

c) Damage that results in listing, leaning, or buckling of the exterior load bearing walls or other vertical "primary structural members" to such an extent that a plumb line passing through the center of gravity does not fall inside the middle one-third of the base as defined within the Florida Building Code;

d) Damage that results in the building, or any portion of the **Building** containing "primary structural members" or "primary structural systems", being significantly likely to imminently collapse because of the movement or instability of the ground within the influence zone of the supporting ground within the sheer plane necessary for the purpose of supporting such **Building** as defined within the Florida Building Code; or

e) Damage occurring on or after October 15, 2005, that qualifies as substantial structural damage as defined in the Florida Building Code.

2) "Primary structural member" means a structural element designed to provide support and stability for the vertical or lateral loads of the overall structure.

3) "Primary structural system" means an assemblage of "primary structural members".

f. If the Companies deny the claim for Sinkhole Loss without performing testing under section 627.7072, Florida Statutes, the Insured may demand testing by communicating such demand to the Companies in writing within 60 days after the Insured receives the Companies' denial of the claim. The Insured is responsible for 50% of the testing costs, or $2,500, whichever is less. If the Companies' professional engineer or geologist provides written certification, pursuant to section 627.7073, that there is sinkhole loss, the Companies will reimburse the Insured for the testing costs.

g. The Insured may not accept a rebate from any person performing repairs for Sinkhole Loss. If the Insured receives a rebate, coverage under this Policy is void and the Insured must refund the amount of the rebate to the Companies.

8. The Commercial Property Compass Form is modified as follows.

The definitions stated above also apply to section B. of this endorsement.

1. DEDUCTIBLE

The deductible in the Declarations applies unless a separate Equipment Breakdown deductible is shown in a schedule. If a separate Equipment Breakdown deductible is shown, the following applies.

Only as regards Equipment Breakdown Coverage, SECTION I -- COVERAGES AND LIMITS OF LIABILITY, paragraph G. is deleted and replaced with the following:

a. Deductibles for Each Coverage

(1) Unless the schedule indicates that the Insured's deductible is for all coverages, multiple deductibles may apply to any one equipment breakdown.

(2) The Companies will not pay for loss, damage or expense under any coverage until the amount of the covered loss, damage or expense exceeds the deductible amount indicated for that coverage in the schedule. The Companies will then pay the amount of loss, damage or expense in excess of the applicable deductible amount, subject to the applicable limit.

<!-- Page 76 -->
(2) Time Deductible

If a time deductible is shown in the schedule, the Companies will not be liable for any loss occurring during the specified number of hours or days immediately following the accident or electronic circuitry impairment. If a time deductible is expressed in days, each day shall mean twenty-four consecutive hours.

(3) Multiple of Average Daily Value (ADV)

If a deductible is expressed as a number times ADV, that amount will be calculated as follows:

The ADV (Average Daily Value) will be the Time Element (as defined in any Time Element Coverage that is part of this policy) that would have been earned during the period of interruption of business had no accident or electronic circuitry impairment occurred, divided by the number of working days in that period. No reduction shall be made for the Time Element not being earned, or in the number of working days, because of the accident or electronic circuitry impairment or any other scheduled or unscheduled shutdowns during the period of interruption. The ADV applies to the Time Element value of the entire Location, whether or not the loss affects the entire Location. If more than one Location is included in the valuation of the loss, the ADV will be the combined value of all affected Locations. The number indicated in the schedule will be multiplied by the ADV as determined above. The result shall be used as the applicable deductible.

(4) Percentage of Loss Deductibles

If a deductible is expressed as a percentage of loss, the Companies will not be liable for the indicated percentage of the gross amount of loss, damage or expense (prior to any applicable deductible or coinsurance) insured under the applicable coverage. If the dollar amount of such percentage is less than the indicated minimum deductible, the minimum deductible will be the applicable deductible.

2. CONDITIONS

The following conditions are in addition to those in SECTION VII – CONDITIONS:

a. Suspension

Whenever covered equipment is found to be in, or exposed to, a dangerous condition, any of the Companies' representatives may immediately suspend the insurance against loss from an accident or electronic circuitry impairment to that covered equipment. This can be done by mailing or delivering a written notice of suspension to:

(1) The Insured's last known address; or
(2) The address where the covered equipment is located.

Once suspended in this way, the Insured's coverage can be reinstated only by an endorsement for that covered equipment. If the Companies suspend the Insured's coverage, the Insured will get a pro rata refund of premium for that covered equipment for the period of suspension. But the suspension will be effective even if the Companies have not yet made or offered a refund.

AR EB 10 16

<!-- Page 77 -->
b. Jurisdictional Inspections
If any property that is covered equipment under this endorsement requires inspection to comply with state or municipal boiler and pressure vessel regulations, the Companies agree to perform such inspection on the Insured's behalf. The Companies do not warrant that conditions are safe or healthful.

c. Coinsurance
If a coinsurance percentage is shown in a schedule for specified coverages, the following condition applies.
The Companies will not pay for the full amount of the Insured's loss if the applicable limit is less than the product of the specified coinsurance percentage times the value of the property subject to the coverage at the time of the loss. Instead, the Companies will determine what percentage this calculated product is compared to the applicable limit and apply that percentage to the gross amount of loss. The Companies will then subtract the applicable deductible. The resulting amount, or the applicable limit, is the most the Companies will pay. The Companies will not pay for the remainder of the loss. Coinsurance applies separately to each insured Location.

3. VALUATION
As respects this endorsement only, SECTION IV - VALUATION in the Commercial Property Compass Form is deleted and replaced with the following:
The Companies will determine the value of Covered Property as follows:

a. Except as specified otherwise, the Companies' payment for damaged Covered Property will be the smallest of:
(1) The cost to repair the damaged property;
(2) The cost to replace the damaged property on the same site; or
(3) The amount the Insured actually spends that is necessary to repair or replace the damaged property.

b. The amount of the Companies' payment will be based on the most cost effective means to replace the function, capacity and remaining useful life of the damaged property. This may include the use of generic, used or reconditioned parts, equipment or property.

c. Except as described in d. below, the Insured must pay the extra cost of replacing damaged property with property of a better kind or quality or of a different size or capacity.

d. Environmental, Safety and Efficiency Improvements
If covered equipment requires replacement due to an accident or electronic circuitry impairment, the Companies will pay the Insured's additional cost to replace with equipment that is better for the environment, safer for people or more energy or water efficient than the equipment being replaced. However, the Companies will not pay to increase the size or capacity of the equipment and the Companies will not pay more than 150% of what the cost would have been to replace with like kind and quality. This provision does not apply to the replacement of component parts or to any property to which Actual Cash Value applies and does not increase any of the applicable limits.

e. The following property will be valued on an Actual Cash Value basis:
(1) Any property that does not currently serve a useful or necessary function for the Insured;
(2) Any Covered Property that the Insured does not repair or replace within 24 months after the date of the accident or electronic circuitry impairment; and

AR EB 10 16
11

---

<!-- Page 78 -->
(3) Any Covered Property for which Actual Cash Value coverage is specified in a schedule, Actual Cash Value includes deductions for depreciation.

f. If any one of the following conditions is met, property held for sale by the Insured will be valued at the sales price as if no loss or damage had occurred, less any discounts and expenses that otherwise would have applied:

(1) The property was manufactured by the Insured;
(2) The sales price of the property is less than the replacement cost of the property; or
(3) The Insured is unable to replace the property before its anticipated sale.

g. Except as specifically provided for under Data Restoration coverage, Electronic Data and Media will be valued on the following basis:

(1) For mass-produced and commercially available software, at the replacement cost.
(2) For all other Electronic Data and Media, at the cost of blank media for reproducing the records. The Companies will not pay for data representing financial records based on the face value of such records.

The most the Companies will pay for loss, damage or expense under this endorsement arising from any one equipment breakdown is the applicable limit of liability shown in SECTION I — COVERAGES AND LIMITS OF LIABILITY, unless otherwise shown in a schedule. Coverage provided under this endorsement does not provide an additional amount of insurance.

# Cosmetic Roof Damage Restriction

In respect of loss or damage by wind and/or hail to a Building or structure:

The Companies will not pay for "cosmetic damage" to "roof surfacing" caused by wind and/or hail.

For the purpose of this endorsement:

Cosmetic damage means that the wind or hail caused marring, pitting or other superficial damage that altered the appearance of the roof surfacing, but such damage does not prevent the roof from continuing to function as a barrier to entrance of the elements to the same extent as it did before the cosmetic damage occurred.

Roof surfacing refers to the shingles, tiles, cladding, metal or synthetic sheeting or similar materials covering the roof and includes all materials used in securing the roof surface and all materials applied to or under the roof surface for moisture protection, as well as roof flashing.

All other terms and conditions remain unchanged.

## Not Purchased Clause

This Clause is issued in accordance with the terms and conditions of the "U.S. Terrorism Risk Insurance Act of 2002" as amended as summarized in the disclosure notice.

It is hereby noted that the Underwriters have made available coverage for "insured losses" directly resulting from an "act of terrorism" as defined in the "U.S. Terrorism Risk Insurance Act of 2002", as amended ("TRIA") and the Insured has declined or not confirmed to purchase this coverage.

# THIS ENDORSEMENT CHANGES THE POLICY. PLEASE READ IT CAREFULLY.

# EXCLUSION OF CERTIFIED ACTS OF TERRORISM

A. The following definition is added with respect to the provisions of this endorsement:

"Certified Act of Terrorism" means an act that is certified by the Secretary of the Treasury, in accordance with the provisions of the federal Terrorism Risk Insurance Act, to be an act of terrorism pursuant to such Act. The criteria contained in the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act for a "Certified Act of Terrorism" include the following:

1. The act resulted in insured losses in excess of $5 million in the aggregate, attributable to all types of insurance subject to the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act; and
2. The act is a violent act or an act that is dangerous to human life, property or infrastructure and is committed by an individual or individuals as part of an effort to coerce the civilian population of the United States or to influence the policy or affect the conduct of the United States Government by coercion.

B. The following exclusion is added:

# CERTIFIED ACT OF TERRORISM EXCLUSION

The Companies will not pay for loss or damage caused directly or indirectly by a "Certified Act of Terrorism". Such loss or damage is excluded regardless of any other cause or event that contributes concurrently or in any sequence to the loss.

C. Exception Covering Certain Fire Losses

As respects to property located in states that have Standard Fire Policy or similar laws mandating that insurance Companies provide coverage for "fire following" any Certified Acts of Terrorism, the following exception to the exclusion in Paragraph B. applies:

If a "Certified Act of Terrorism" results in fire, the Companies will pay for the loss or damage caused by that fire. Such coverage for fire applies only to direct loss or damage by fire to Covered Property. Therefore, for example, the coverage does not apply to insurance provided under Business Income and/or Extra Expense coverage forms or

AR TRIA EXCL 03 21

---

<!-- Page 128 -->
endorsements which apply to those forms, or to the Legal Liability Coverage Form or the Leasehold Interest Coverage Form.

If aggregate insured losses attributable to terrorist acts certified under the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act exceed $100 billion in a calendar year and the Companies have met their insurer deductible under the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act, the Companies shall not be liable for the payment of any portion of the amount of such losses that exceeds $100 billion, and in such case insured losses up to that amount are subject to pro rata allocation in accordance with procedures established by the Secretary of the Treasury.

## D. Application Of Other Exclusions

The terms and limitations of any terrorism exclusion, or the inapplicability or omission of a terrorism exclusion, do not serve to create coverage for any loss which would otherwise be excluded under this Coverage Part or Policy, such as losses excluded by the Nuclear Hazard Exclusion or the War and Military Action Exclusion.

All other terms and conditions remain unchanged.
