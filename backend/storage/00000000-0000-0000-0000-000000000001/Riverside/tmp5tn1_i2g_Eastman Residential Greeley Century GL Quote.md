# Insurance Proposal

## Cost Summary
|  General Liability Premium | $28,063.00  |
| --- | --- |
|  Policy Fee | $250.00  |
|  Inspection Fee | $125.00  |
|  CO Surplus Lines Tax | $853.14  |
|  Total Policy Cost | $29,291.14  |

## Minimum Earned
Note: There may be a minimum earned on this policy. Please refer to the carrier quote for more details on the minimum earned percentage.

## Disclosures
RT Specialty is typically compensated through commission from the insurer for the placement of policies in most transactions. The amount of the commission varies by insurance line and by carrier. RT Specialty might also receive additional compensation. In order to place the insurance requested we may charge a reasonable fee for additional services such as performing a risk analysis, comparing policies, processing submissions, communication expenses, inspections, working with underwriters on the coverage proposal, issuing policies, or servicing the policy after issuance. Any fees charged are fully earned at inception of the policy. Third-party inspection or other fees may be separately itemized upon request. Our fees are applied to new policies, renewal policies, and endorsements. Fees applicable to each renewal and endorsement will be set forth in the quotes. It is the insurance carrier's decision whether to offer the insurance quoted, and your client's decision whether to accept the quote. Our fee is not imposed by state law or the Insurer.

Depending upon the Insurer involved with your placement, we might also have an agreement with the Insurer that we are proposing for this placement that might pay us future additional compensation. This compensation could be based on formulas that consider the volume of business placed with the Insurer, the profitability of that business, how much of the business is retained for the Insurer's account each year, and potentially other factors. The agreements frequently consider total eligible premium from all clients placed during a calendar year and any incentive or contingent compensation is often received at a future date. Because of variables in these agreements, we often do not have an accurate means at the time of placement to determine the amount of any additional compensation that might be attributable to any single placement. You, as the retail broker with the direct relationship with the Insured, must comply with all applicable laws and regulations related to disclosure of and consent and agreement to, compensation, and informing the Insured that it may request more information about producer or broker compensation that might be paid in connection with the Insured's placement. If we request a copy of any legally required insured consent or agreement, you will provide us with a copy. If you need additional information about the compensation arrangements for services provided by RT Specialty affiliates, please contact your RT Specialty representative.

RT Specialty is a division of RSG Specialty, LLC. RSG Specialty, LLC is a Delaware limited liability company and a subsidiary of Ryan Specialty, LLC. In California: RSG Specialty Insurance Services, LLC (License # 0G97516).

# POLICYHOLDER DISCLOSURE

# NOTICE OF TERRORISM INSURANCE COVERAGE

Coverage for acts of terrorism is included in your policy. As defined in Section 102(1) of the Act: The term "act of terrorism" means any act that is certified by the Secretary of the Treasury—in consultation with the Secretary of Homeland Security, and the Attorney General of the United States—to be an act of terrorism; to be a violent act or an act that is dangerous to human life, property, or infrastructure; to have resulted in damage within the United States, or outside the United States in the case of certain air carriers or vessels or the premises of a United States mission; and to have been committed by an individual or individuals as part of an effort to coerce the civilian population of the United States or to influence the policy or affect the conduct of the United States Government by coercion. Under your coverage, any losses resulting from certified acts of terrorism may be partially reimbursed by the United States Government under a formula established by the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act, as amended. However, your policy may contain other exclusions which might affect your coverage, such as an exclusion for nuclear events. Under the formula, the United States Government generally reimburses 80% beginning January 1, 2020 of covered terrorism losses exceeding the statutorily established deductible paid by the insurance company providing the coverage.

However, if the aggregate insured losses attributable to terrorist acts certified under the Terrorism Risk Insurance exceed $100 billion in a calendar year, the Treasury shall not make any payment for any portion of the amount of such losses that exceeds $100 billion.

If aggregate insured losses attributable to terrorism acts certified under the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act exceed $100 billion in a calendar year and we have met our insurer deductible under the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act, we shall not be liable for the payment of any portion of the amount of such losses that exceeds $100 billion, and in such case insured losses up to that amount are subject to pro-rata allocation in accordance with the procedures established by the Secretary of the Treasury.

The portion of your annual premium that is attributable to coverage for acts of terrorism is as shown below. This premium does not include any charges for the portion of losses covered by the United States government under the Act.

# PRODUCING AGENT (RETAIL PRODUCER OR SURPLUS LINES BROKER) DILIGENT EFFORT AFFIDAVIT
(§§ 10-5-103, 10-5-103.5, C.R.S., &amp; Section 6 of Regulation 2-4-1)

As a surplus lines broker, I have determined, or if the insurance was produced by a retail producer, I have relied upon the retail producer to determine that the full amount of insurance required was not procurable, after diligent effort had been made to do so, from among at least three (3) admitted insurers authorized to and actually transacting that line of business in this state. Or that the coverage was not procurable because there were less than three (3) admitted insurers authorized to and actually transacting that line of business in this state. Further, that placing the insurance with a non-admitted insurer was not for the purpose of securing a lower premium rate than which would be accepted by an admitted insurer unless the premium rate quoted by the admitted insurer must be ten (10) percent higher than that rate quoted by the non-admitted insurer. In addition, the policy benefits and provisions within the policies being compared shall be comparatively similar.
