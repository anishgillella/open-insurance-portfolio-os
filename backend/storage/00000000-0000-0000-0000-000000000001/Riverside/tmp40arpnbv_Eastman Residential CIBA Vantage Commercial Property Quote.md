# HOME STATE FOR NON-ADMITTED RISKS

Taxes and governmental fees are estimates and subject to change based upon current rates of the Home State and risk information available at the date of binding. The Home State of the Insured for a non-admitted risk shall be determined in accordance with the Nonadmitted and Reinsurance Act of 2010, 15. U.S.C §8201, etc. ("NRRA"). Some states require the producing broker to submit a written verification of the insured's Home State for our records. The applicable law (if any) of the Home State governing cancellation or non-renewal of non-admitted insurance, including whether any such laws apply to non-admitted risks, shall apply to this Policy.

# BINDING INSTRUCTIONS

We will only bind coverage in writing after we receive a written request from you to bind coverage. If coverage is requested, the following items must be submitted:

There are subjectivities that:

- must be complied with or resolved before the contract becomes binding
- apply both before or after inception, compliance with which is a condition of all or part of the coverage; and
- apply after the formation of the contract as conditions of continued coverage.

Failure to provide or comply with these subjectivities might results in a refusal to bind or cancellation of coverage, at the insurer's option. Please note that this is a quote only, and the Insurer reserves the right to amend or withdraw the quote if new, corrected or updated information is received. You must notify us of any material change in the risk exposure occurring after submission of the application. If the Insurer binds the risk following your written request, the terms of the policy currently in use by the Insurer will supersede the quote.

Any amendments to coverage must be specifically requested in writing or by submitting a policy change request form and then approved by the Insurer. Coverage cannot be affected, amended, extended or altered through the issuance of certificates of insurance. Underlying Insurers must be rated A-VII or better by A.M. Best.

This quote summary, the quote, the fees quoted and our advice, is confidential. This quote summary and the quote constitutes the entire understanding and supersedes any and all agreements and communications respecting the insurance offered. If you need further information about the quote, our fee or the Insurer that is proposing to provide your insurance, please contact us.

PREMIUM FINANCE (If not included in the quote document)

If the insured and the insurer agree to bind coverage and the premium will be financed, upon binding, please instruct the premium finance company to send documents to our attention. Premium Finance funds should always be paid to RT Specialty.

# PRODUCER COMPENSATION:

RT Specialty is typically compensated through commission from the insurer for the placement of policies in most transactions. The amount of the commission varies by insurance line and by carrier. RT Specialty might also receive additional compensation. In order to place the insurance requested we may charge a reasonable fee for additional services such as performing a risk analysis, comparing policies, processing submissions, communication expenses, inspections, working with underwriters on the coverage proposal, issuing policies, or servicing the policy after issuance. Any fees charged are fully earned at inception of the policy. Third-party inspection or other fees may be separately itemized upon request. Our fees are applied to new policies, renewal policies, and endorsements. Fees applicable to each renewal and endorsement will be set forth in the quotes. It is the insurance carrier's decision whether to offer the insurance quoted, and your client's decision whether to accept the quote. Our fee is not imposed by state law or the Insurer.

Depending upon the Insurer involved with your placement, we might also have an agreement with the Insurer that we are proposing for this placement that might pay us future additional compensation. This compensation could be based on formulas that consider the volume of business placed with the Insurer, the profitability of that business, how much of the business is retained for the Insurer's account each year, and potentially other factors. The agreements frequently consider total eligible premium from all clients placed during a calendar year and any incentive or contingent compensation is often received at a future date. Because of variables in these agreements, we often do not have an accurate means at the time of placement to determine the amount of any additional compensation that might be attributable to any single placement.

You, as the retail broker with the direct relationship with the Insured, must comply with all applicable laws and regulations related to disclosure of and consent and agreement to, compensation, and informing the Insured that it may request more information about producer or broker compensation that might be paid in connection with the Insured's placement. If we request a copy of any legally required insured consent or agreement, you will provide us with a copy. If you need additional information about the compensation arrangements for services provided by RT Specialty affiliates, please contact your RT Specialty representative.

RT Specialty is a division of RSG Specialty, LLC. RSG Specialty, LLC is a Delaware limited liability company and a subsidiary of Ryan Specialty, LLC. In California: RSG Specialty Insurance Services, LLC (License # 0G97516).

Unless this quote is amended or withdrawn it is valid for 30 days from the date shown above, or the proposed effective date, whichever is earlier. This quote can be amended or withdrawn at any time prior to acceptance by the insured. If the quote included with this letter provides otherwise, or in any way conflicts with this letter, the terms of the quote shall govern and control.

# NOTICE
Occurrence Limit of Liability (OLLE)
Scheduled Limits

Blanket coverage for first-party property insurance risks has become increasingly difficult to secure and often is not available regardless of price.

Please note that your quote may not provide coverage on a blanket basis and, based on current market conditions, a blanket coverage option might not be available. Any reference(s) to an Occurrence Limit of Liability Endorsement (OLLE), margin clause, maximum amount payable, and/or scheduled limits indicate that blanket coverage is not provided. Instead, the amount of recovery afforded by the policy is limited in some respect to the amount(s) set forth on the Statement of Values (SOV) provided to the insurer. This potentially can materially reduce the insured's recovery in the event of a loss as compared to blanket coverage. Additionally, the policy language for these clauses may vary by insurer and some insurers limit the amount recoverable for extensions of coverage, additional coverages, and additional covered property to the values as shown on the SOV.

Please review this quote very carefully to determine if coverage is being offered or provided on a blanket, or some other more limited, basis.

As such, we strongly recommend that you confirm that the insured is in agreement that they have provided full and accurate amounts for the values set forth on the SOV. RT Specialty expressly disclaims any responsibility for the accuracy or adequacy of the values provided on an SOV. We also note that all decisions concerning coverage and the application of the terms, provisions, conditions, limitations or exclusions of the policy to any claim are made exclusively by the insurers.

# PRODUCING AGENT (RETAIL PRODUCER OR SURPLUS LINES BROKER) DILIGENT EFFORT AFFIDAVIT

(§§ 10-5-103, 10-5-103.5, C.R.S., &amp; Section 6 of Regulation 2-4-1)

As a surplus lines broker, I have determined, or if the insurance was produced by a retail producer, I have relied upon the retail producer to determine that the full amount of insurance required was not procurable, after diligent effort had been made to do so, from among at least three (3) admitted insurers authorized to and actually transacting that line of business in this state. Or that the coverage was not procurable because there were less than three (3) admitted insurers authorized to and actually transacting that line of business in this state. Further, that placing the insurance with a non-admitted insurer was not for the purpose of securing a lower premium rate than which would be accepted by an admitted insurer unless the premium rate quoted by the admitted insurer must be ten (10) percent higher than that rate quoted by the non-admitted insurer. In addition, the policy benefits and provisions within the policies being compared shall be comparatively similar.

Several Liability:

PLEASE NOTE – This notice contains important information. PLEASE READ CAREFULLY

The liability of an insurer under this contract is several and not joint with other insurers party to this contract. An insurer is liable only for the proportion of liability it has underwritten. An insurer is not jointly liable for the proportion of liability underwritten by any other insurer. Nor is an insurer otherwise responsible for any liability of any other insurer that may underwrite this contract.

The proportion of liability under this contract underwritten by an insurer (or, in the case of a Lloyd’s syndicate, the total of the proportions underwritten by all the members of the syndicate taken together) is shown above.

In the case of a Lloyd’s syndicate, each member of the syndicate (rather than the syndicate itself) is an insurer. Each member has underwritten a proportion of the total shown for the syndicate (that total itself being the total of the proportions underwritten by all the members of the syndicate taken together). The liability of each member of the syndicate is several and not joint with other members. A member is liable only for that member’s proportion. A member is not jointly liable for any other member’s proportion. Nor is any member otherwise responsible for any liability of any other insurer that may underwrite this contract. The business address of each member is Lloyd’s, One Lime Street, London EC3M 7HA. The identity of each member of a Lloyd’s syndicate and their respective proportion may be obtained by writing to Market Services, Lloyd’s, at the above address.

Although reference is made at various points in this clause to “this contract” in the singular, where the circumstances so require this should be read as a reference to contracts in the plural.

# WATER DAMAGE DEDUCTIBLE $50,000 - PER BUILDING

In consideration of the premium charged, it is agreed that the following coverage change applies, but only to coverage provided at insured locations identified by “Property Identification Numbers” where the Declarations Page or Evidence of Commercial Property Insurance issued to the Named Insured by CIBA Insurance Services states that this endorsement applies.

If loss or damage caused by or resulting from covered water damage occurs, we will not pay for such loss or damage in any one occurrence until the amount of loss or damage exceeds $50,000 Per Building at each location scheduled in the Commercial Lines Declarations Page and Schedule of Locations. We will then pay the amount of loss or damage in excess of the deductible, up to the applicable limit of insurance.

This deductible does not apply to loss or damage:

1. caused by water discharged by a fire protective system in response to a fire.

If the Deductible contained in the Commercial Lines Declarations Page and Schedule of Locations is greater than the sum of the Water Damage Deductibles applicable to the loss or damage at all buildings, we will apply the Deductible contained in the Commercial Lines Declarations Page and Schedule of Locations instead of the Water Damage Deductible.

Example 1:

Building Limit of Insurance: $2,000,000; Deductible: $5,000; Water Damage Deductible – Per Building: $5,000.

Three buildings suffer water damage of $150,000 total divided equally between three buildings at $50,000 each building.

The applicable deductible is $15,000 (per building deductible of $5,000 times three) because the Water Damage Deductible is greater than the Standard Deductible of $5,000. The loss payment is $135,000 ($150,000 less $15,000).

Example 2:

Building Limit of Insurance: $2,000,000; Deductible: $10,000; Water Damage Deductible – Per Building: $5,000.

One building suffers water damage of $50,000.

The applicable deductible is $10,000 because the Standard Deductible is greater than the Water Damage Deductible of $5,000. The loss payment is $40,000 ($50,000 less $10,000).

Example 3:

Building Limit of Insurance: $2,000,000; Deductible $5,000; Water Damage Deductible- Per Building: $20,000.

Two buildings suffer water damage of $10,000 and $30,000 each.

Damage to the first building is within the Water Damage deductible. The applicable deductible for the second building is $20,000.

The Loss Payment is $10,000 ($10,000 not paid at Building 1 due to being less than the Per Building deductible of $20,000 and $30,000 less $20,000 at building 2).

# NOTICE OF TERRORISM INSURANCE COVERAGE

You are hereby notified that under the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act, as amended, you have a right to purchase insurance coverage for losses resulting from acts of terrorism, as defined in Section 102(1) of the Act: The term "act of terrorism" means any act that is certified by the Secretary of the Treasury in consultation with the Secretary of Homeland Security, and the Attorney General of the United States to be an act of terrorism; to be a violent act or an act that is dangerous to human life, property, or infrastructure; to have resulted in damage within the United States, or outside the United States in the case of certain air carriers or vessels or the premises of a United States mission; and to have been committed by an individual or individuals as part of an effort to coerce the civilian population of the United States or to influence the policy or affect the conduct of the United States Government by coercion.

YOU SHOULD KNOW THAT WHERE COVERAGE IS PROVIDED BY THIS POLICY FOR LOSSES RESULTING FROM CERTIFIED ACTS OF TERRORISM, SUCH LOSSES MAY BE PARTIALLY REIMBURSED BY THE UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT UNDER A FORMULA ESTABLISHED BY FEDERAL LAW. HOWEVER, YOUR POLICY MAY CONTAIN OTHER EXCLUSIONS WHICH MIGHT AFFECT YOUR COVERAGE, SUCH AS AN EXCLUSION FOR NUCLEAR EVENTS. UNDER THE FORMULA, THE UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT GENERALLY REIMBURSES 85% THROUGH 2015; 84% BEGINNING ON JANUARY 1, 2016; 83% BEGINNING ON JANUARY 1, 2017; 82% BEGINNING ON JANUARY 1, 2018; 81% BEGINNING ON JANUARY 1, 2019 AND 80% BEGINNING ON JANUARY 1, 2020 OF COVERED TERRORISM LOSSES EXCEEDING THE STATUTORILY ESTABLISHED DEDUCTIBLE PAID BY THE INSURANCE COMPANY PROVIDING THE COVERAGE. THE PREMIUM CHARGED FOR THIS COVERAGE IS PROVIDED BELOW AND DOES NOT INCLUDE ANY CHARGES FOR THE PORTION OF LOSS THAT MAY BE COVERED BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT UNDER THE ACT.

YOU SHOULD ALSO KNOW THAT THE TERRORISM RISK INSURANCE ACT, AS AMENDED, CONTAINS A $100 BILLION CAP THAT LIMITS U.S. GOVERNMENT REIMBURSEMENT AS WELL AS INSURERS' LIABILITY FOR LOSSES RESULTING FROM CERTIFIED ACTS OF TERRORISM WHEN THE AMOUNT OF SUCH LOSSES IN ANY ONE CALENDAR YEAR EXCEEDS $100 BILLION. IF THE AGGREGATE INSURED LOSSES FOR ALL INSURERS EXCEED $100 BILLION, YOUR COVERAGE MAY BE REDUCED.

CIBA offers the following two different types of terrorism insurance options from two different insurers. You may elect either one, but not both. You do not have to purchase either of these coverages.
