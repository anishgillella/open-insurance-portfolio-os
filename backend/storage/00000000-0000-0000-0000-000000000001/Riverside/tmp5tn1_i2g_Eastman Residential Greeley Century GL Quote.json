Please refer to the carrier quote for more details on the minimum earned percentage.\n\n## Disclosures\nRT Specialty is typically compensated through commission from the insurer for the placement of policies in most transactions. The amount of the commission varies by insurance line and by carrier. RT Specialty might also receive additional compensation. In order to place the insurance requested we may charge a reasonable fee for additional services such as performing a risk analysis, comparing policies, processing submissions, communication expenses, inspections, working with underwriters on the coverage proposal, issuing policies, or servicing the policy after issuance. Any fees charged are fully earned at inception of the policy. Third-party inspection or other fees may be separately itemized upon request. Our fees are applied to new policies, renewal policies, and endorsements. Fees applicable to each renewal and endorsement will be set forth in the quotes. It is the insurance carrier's decision whether to offer the insurance quoted, and your client's decision whether to accept the quote. Our fee is not imposed by state law or the Insurer.\n\nDepending upon the Insurer involved with your placement, we might also have an agreement with the Insurer that we are proposing for this placement that might pay us future additional compensation. This compensation could be based on formulas that consider the volume of business placed with the Insurer, the profitability of that business, how much of the business is retained for the Insurer's account each year, and potentially other factors. The agreements frequently consider total eligible premium from all clients placed during a calendar year and any incentive or contingent compensation is often received at a future date. Because of variables in these agreements, we often do not have an accurate means at the time of placement to determine the amount of any additional compensation that might be attributable to any single placement. You, as the retail broker with the direct relationship with the Insured, must comply with all applicable laws and regulations related to disclosure of and consent and agreement to, compensation, and informing the Insured that it may request more information about producer or broker compensation that might be paid in connection with the Insured's placement. If we request a copy of any legally required insured consent or agreement, you will provide us with a copy. If you need additional information about the compensation arrangements for services provided by RT Specialty affiliates, please contact your RT Specialty representative.\n\nRT Specialty is a division of RSG Specialty, LLC.
