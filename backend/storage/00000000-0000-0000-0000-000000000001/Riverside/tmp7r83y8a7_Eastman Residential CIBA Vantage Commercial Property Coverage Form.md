The appraisers shall then select a competent and disinterested umpire. If they should fail for 15 days to agree upon such umpire, then upon the request of the "Named Insured" or of the Insurer, such umpire shall be selected by a judge of a court of record in the county and state in which such appraisal is pending. Then, at a reasonable time and place, the appraisers shall appraise the loss, stating separately the value at the time of loss and the amount of loss. If the appraisers fail to agree, they shall submit their differences to the umpire. An award in writing by any two shall determine the amount of loss. The "Named Insured" and the Insurer shall each pay his or its chosen appraiser and shall bear equally the other expenses of the appraisal and of the umpire.

If there is an appraisal, the Insurer will still retain its right to deny the claim.

## 18. MORTGAGE CLAUSE

## 19. PAYMENT OF LOSS

All adjusted claims shall be due and payable not later than 30 days after presentation and acceptance of proofs of loss by the Insurer or its appointed representative.

(3) If the "Named Insured" cancels for any other reason than the insured property being sold, earned premium shall be computed in accordance with the customary short rate table, subject to a minimum earned premium regardless of the timing of the cancellation.

cancels, earned premium shall be computed pro rata. The cancellation will be effective even if the Insurer has not made or offered a refund.

In the event of cancellation, not less than 25% of the premium will be retained as a minimum earned premium for the period that the Insurer is on risk.
